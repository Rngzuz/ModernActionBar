# ModernActionBar
Restores the default retail layout of action bars, bag buttons and micro buttons, with modifications made to the bag/micro bar to accommodate for the key ring and number of micro buttons.

## Known issues
Due to the WoW API being restricted while in combat, interface options affecting action bars and toggling of showing reputation as the experience bar, are disabled until leaving combat.
